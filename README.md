## Hi there! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub! I am a work in progress, trying to create space to highlight my projects and interests.

<kbd>Data Science</kbd> <kbd>Computational Omics</kbd> <kbd>Research</kbd> <kbd>Analysis</kbd> <kbd>Visualization</kbd> <kbd>R</kbd>

Currently, I'm focused on machine learning for survival or time-to-event data🙇‍♀️, analyzing lung transplant outcomes and crafting visualizations🔭for a few manuscripts. You'll often find me experimenting🤔with tools like <kbd>BioRender</kbd> and <kbd>Illustrator</kbd>🤷  

Thanks for stopping by!

### A Binge-Worthy Journey - from Data to Discovery
Good data analysis is like Netflix for Numbers 🎬 it narrates a saga of discovery 🔍 where every dataset has a story waiting to stream✨

### When Data Speak, Opinions Listen
Data turn opinions into insights💡📊 Without data, opinions are just noise 🔇
