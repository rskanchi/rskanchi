## Hi there! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub! I am a work in progress, trying to create space to highlight my projects and interests.

<kbd>Data Science</kbd> <kbd>Computational Omics</kbd> <kbd>Research</kbd> <kbd>Analysis</kbd> <kbd>Visualization</kbd> <kbd>R</kbd>

Currently, I'm focused on machine learning for survival or time-to-event data🙇‍♀️and crafting visualizations🔭🤔 for a few manuscripts. You'll often find me experimenting with tools like <kbd>BioRender</kbd> and <kbd>illustrator</kbd>🤷  

Thanks for stopping by! Feel free to connect with me on:

And now, a touch of randomness:

### The Continuous Whisper of Random Variables  
🎲Two random variables were gossiping, thinking they were discrete by whispering... but I overheard their chatter continuously!😄
