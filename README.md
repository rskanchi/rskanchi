## Hi there! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub! I am a work in progress, trying to create space to highlight my projects and interests.

<kbd>Data Science</kbd> <kbd>Computational Omics</kbd> <kbd>Research</kbd> <kbd>Analytics</kbd> <kbd>Visualization</kbd> <kbd>R</kbd>

Currently, I'm expanding an existing machine learning workflow to integrate additional methods focused on regularization, getting my feet wet with multimodal modeling🤔, and also exploring building LLMs from scratch🤖. As usual🤷, I'm working on multiple projects across lung transplant outcomes and pediatric liver diseases, some in data preprocesing stage🙇‍♀️ some in analysis, while some inching towards manuscript writing and submission. Excitingly, our work on plasma proteome correlations with liver stiffness in pediatric cholestasis will be published soon in Hepatology Communications.
 
Thanks for stopping by!

### A Binge-Worthy Journey - from Data to Discovery
Good data analysis is like Netflix for Numbers 🎬 it narrates a saga of discovery 🔍 where every dataset has a story waiting to stream✨

### When Data Speak, Opinions Listen
Data turn opinions into insights💡📊 Without data, opinions are just noise 🔇
