# Hi there! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub! This space is constantly evolving as I share the projects and ideas I'm exploring.

I developed a machine learning workflow that performs both classification and regression tasks using a range of methods, including tree-based (Random Forest), instance-based (KNN), kernel-based (SVM), boosting (GBM), and regularization approaches (Lasso, Elastic Net, Ridge). Currently, I’m exploring deep learning for image analysis and multimodal modeling 🤔. As usual 🤷, I’m working on multiple projects across lung transplant outcomes and pediatric liver diseases — some in data preprocessing 🙇‍♀️, some in analysis, and others inching toward manuscript submission.

Our recent work on **plasma proteome correlations with liver stiffness in pediatric cholestasis** is [now published](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41021277/) in *Hepatology Communications*. Another study on extracellular vesicle mRNA profiles in ex vivo lung perfusion and their implications for primary graft dysfunction in lung transplantation is currently under peer review.
  
Thanks for stopping by!

## A Binge-Worthy Journey - from Data to Discovery

Good data analysis is like Netflix for Numbers 🎬 it narrates a saga of discovery 🔍 where every dataset has a story waiting to stream✨

## When Data Speak, Opinions Listen

Data turn opinions into insights💡📊 Without data, opinions are just noise 🔇
